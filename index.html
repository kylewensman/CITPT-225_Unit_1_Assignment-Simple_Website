            <h2>Disabilities</h2>
            <p>I have aspergers which can make things difficult at times, but not impossible</p>
            <p>For my high school senior project I chose aspergers for my subject. I held an event where people could come and talk to me and ask questions. I managed to get an article written in the Lewiston Tribune.</p>

                <p>Lewiston High School senior Kyle Wensman likes bike riding and listening to music - at "max volume."</p>

                <p>Kyle participated in band and competed on the wrestling team throughout high school.</p>

                <p>At 18, he does a lot that typical teenagers do, but he's not typical. Kyle lives with Asperger's syndrome, a form of high-functioning autism.</p>

                <p>His senior project culminates today with an information fair designed to help people understand how hard he works to navigate simple social interactions, to concentrate in class, to avoid meltdowns when he is anxious. He hopes sharing his story will promote understanding of autism spectrum disorders among residents of the Lewiston-Clarkston Valley.</p>

                <p>"I just wanted to do the project to help other people out," he said.</p>

                <p>Senior projects - which include writing a research paper, working with a community mentor and presenting the results to a panel of judges - have been a graduation requirement for Idaho public school students for six years. The information fair, from 4 to 6 p.m. at Booth Hall, is a key component of Kyle's project.</p>

                <p>Sitting at a picnic table outside Lewiston High School after classes earlier this week, Kyle explained what living with Asperger's is like for him.</p>

                <p>"It's always been difficult for me," he said. "Especially in school."</p>

                <p>He frequently was sent to the principal's office in elementary school, he said.</p>

                <p>"I didn't know how to socialize," he said. "I was always kind of awkward. I'd just get in people's way."</p>

                <p>Kyle credits his mother, Billie, for the progress he's made - socially and academically - since elementary school.</p>

                <p>Billie Wensman calls herself a "pushy mom." When it was clear something was different about her son, she researched autism spectrum disorders and pushed for a diagnosis. She hasn't stopped pushing since, whether it's doctors, school officials - or Kyle.</p>

                <p>"He's in drama, band, wrestling," she said. "He plays multiple instruments."</p>

                <p>Kyle started wrestling in fifth grade, and he found a group of peers within the sport who continue to help him build social skills.</p>

                <p>"That really helped me create friendships," he said.</p>

                <p>He's been invited to serve as an assistant coach for the LHS wrestling team next year, he said, an offer he's weighing as he prepares to move on to Lewis-Clark State College to study computer programming.</p>

                <p>As much as she and Kyle have learned and shared, Billie said, finding the understanding and support he needs remains a struggle.</p>

                <p>"I feel like I'm beating my head on a brick wall for the last 12 years," she said.</p>

                <p>People often make assumptions based on Kyle's lack of obvious physical differences, she said, a common source of frustration among those on the autism spectrum.</p>

                <p>"Not all disabilities have a look," she said.</p>

                <p>As difficult as school has been at times, some of his breakthroughs have come thanks to teachers who understood his struggle and went out of their way for him.</p>

                <p>"In seventh grade, there was a math teacher that helped me a lot," Kyle said. "And that was Dawn Burr."</p>

                <p>Having autism involves a host of challenges, but has benefits as well, Billie said. She reminds her son that many famous scientists and inventors likely were on the autism spectrum, including Albert Einstein. People with high-functioning autism, she said, often have a remarkable ability to stay focused until they figure out a problem they're working on.</p>

                <p>"The rest of us would give up," she said.</p>

                <p>Kyle chose the theme "A Walk in My Shoes" for the information fair, where he and representatives from several valley agencies - such as Special Olympics and Disability Action Center - will be available to answer questions.</p>

                <p>"He'd like people to give him the chance to get to know him," Billie said.</p>

                <p>Proceeds from sales of T-shirts at the event will benefit the Green Apple Project, a valley-based organization promoting autism awareness and support. Additional information is available online at www.greenappleproject.org.</p>

            <p>The first time I heard this song was on a Scooby-Doo DVD in the bonus content. I believe I was in 7<sup>th</sup> grade. It depicts the feelings I was going through in elementary / early junior high. The end of 7<sup>th</sup> grade I found 4 people that I clicked with and also had problems. Tragically the one I related to the most killed himself. Side story, I got to know his brother (who is a jackass) and in turn got to know Fabian who they kicked out (like I said the brother is a jackass).The part that is still true today is locking myself in my room and turning up the music.</p>
